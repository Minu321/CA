    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advice a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks?
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      There are several measures that potential clients can take to secure their
      website.
      <br />
      One is to obtain an SSL/TSL certificate and configure the website to
      HTTPS. This ensures that communication through the website is encrypted so
      that potential attackers can't steal data.
      <br />
      <br />
      The client should practice data sanitation either manually or by a third
      party software. This will neutralize mallicious content and ensure that
      only expected formats and standards are accepted as data input. By doing
      this the client can prevent attacks such as sql injections and cross-site
      scripting.
      <br />
      <br />
      Protect users who have left their credentials in the browser window for
      too long by implementing automatic user time-out.
      <br />
      <br />
      Make sure that all third-party applications used for the website is
      trustworthy by doing proper research before using it.
      <br />
      <br />
      The CI/CD approach can improve the websites's security in several ways:
      <br />
      1. ci/cd pipelines can be configured to automatiocally run security,
      vulnerability and penetration testing on each code change.
      <br />
      2. The automated process will also allow for faster and more efficient
      deployment of security updates and paches which narrows down the window
      for a potential attacker to exploit a weakness.
      <br />
      3. You can set up controlled access to the page's code and infrastructure
      which reduces the risk of unauthorized access and security breaches.
